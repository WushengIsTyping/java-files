# README

* This folder is for seperate java files. 
* Folder "myMavenProject" and "myMavenProject2" are some tries of building Maven projects.
* In myMavenProject, there's a .xml file, which can be used for generating Maven projects. But for some reasons I'm not sure, maybe the gfw, I cannot generate Maven projects successfully either with remote catalog, internal catalog or local catalog.
* I followed an instruction (https://blog.csdn.net/luckytsw/article/details/85866497) and add local repository and a mirror link for downloading some files, it works.
